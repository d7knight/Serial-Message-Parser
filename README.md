# Serial-Message-Parser
Interview-Challenge-Sept-12-2015

This is an assignment which I completed as part of the interview proccess for a full-stack-developer position.

I programmed the serial message parser in C++ and also used Jetbrains Clion IDE.

#Setup Steps  

1. clone the repo 
2. open a terminal  
3. execute `cmake .` 
4. execute `make`  
5. execute `./skyladders`  

-There are three messages with message id's 1,2 and 3 being read from the serial adapter. Furthermore there is garbage data being received between each of the messages. It is intentional that there are some messages that don't have a matching checksum to test out the parser's discarding behaviour.
